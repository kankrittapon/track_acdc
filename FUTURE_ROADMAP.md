# Future Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Enhanced Intelligence (AI Integration)
- **Predictive Movement:** Use AI to predict the next likely position of a unit based on terrain and speed.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Automatically alert command if a unit deviates from the patrol path or stops unexpectedly for too long.
- **Threat Assessment:** Analyze proximity to known danger zones.

## Phase 2: Advanced Visualization
- **3D Terrain Mode:** Upgrade map view to 3D to visualize elevation and line-of-sight.
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Overlay tactical data on camera feeds for field commanders.
- **Heatmaps:** Visualize areas of high activity or engagement over time.

## Phase 3: Connected Battlefield
- **Radio Integration:** Link voice comms channels directly to unit icons.
- **Drone Feeds:** Picture-in-Picture video feeds from drones associated with specific coordinates.
- **Satellite Backup:** Fallback communication for denied environments.

## Phase 4: Tactical Simulation
- **Wargaming Mode:** Simulate "Red vs Blue" scenarios using the same map engine.
- **Mission Planning:** Draw waypoints and have virtual units execute the plan for review before deployment.
